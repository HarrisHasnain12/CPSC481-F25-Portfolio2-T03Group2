## App Instructions:

- This app can be ran either by following the link to the deployed application in our portfolio 2 submission, or by forking / cloning this repo and opening the HTML file directly (running the deployed application is the recommended approach).
- When running this app on a laptop / computer, the UI will be inside of a tall rectangular container meant to simulate a phone screen (although this is meant to be a mobile app, it does not yet support being run on an actual mobile device, so please run it on a computer).
- The nav-bar at the bottom of the screen will allow navigation between the major components of the app, and the components themselves are mostly contained to individual pages.
- For a detailed explanation of the app's major features and functionality, please refer to our demo video, or our report. Both of which are included in our portfolio 2 submission.
