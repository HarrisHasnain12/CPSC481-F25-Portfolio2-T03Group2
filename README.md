## App Instructions:

- This app can be ran either by following the link to the deployed application in our portfolio 2 submission, or by forking / cloning this repo and opening the HTML file directly (running the deployed application is the recommended approach).
- When running this app on a laptop / computer, the UI will be inside of a tall rectangular container meant to simulate a phone screen (although this is meant to be a mobile app, it does not yet support being run on an actual mobile device, so please run it in a browser on a computer).
- When starting the app, it should load the home screen, which will have 3 options for navigating to the app's major features (ticket purchasing, event browsing, and convention map). There is also a nav-bar at the bottom of the screen that allows for quick navigation between pages.
- The ticket purchasing feature can only be accessed from the "buy tickets" button on the home screen, and is not on the nav-bar, since users will most likely only need to buy their tickets once. Therefore, the nav-bar is reserved for navigating between pages that users will use multiple times in the application, such as event browsing and the convention map.
- As mentioned, the nav-bar at the bottom of the screen will allow navigation between the major components of the app, and the components themselves are mostly contained to individual pages for simplicity and ease of access.
- For a detailed explanation of the app's major features and functionality, please refer to our demo video, or our report. Both of which are included in our portfolio 2 submission.

# IMPORTANT NOTE: The ticket purchasing feature of this application ONLY works on Chromium browsers (ex, Google Chrome), and does NOT work on non-chromium browsers such as Safari (due to non-chromium browsers blocking 3rd party cookies by default). Therefore, it is HIGHLY recommended to run this app on Google Chrome, to ensure all the functionality works.
